      JavaScript instructions for you:

      1. Add event listeners to buttons to update the display with values.
      2. Parse the input expression and compute result when equals (=) is clicked.
      3. Implement clearing the display on clear (C).
      4. Handle cases like multiple operators in a row and decimal points.
      5. Show error messages or handle invalid inputs gracefully.
      6. Bonus: Add keyboard input support for numbers and operators.

      Use these steps to build up your calculator functionality.
